Detecting significant mutational intra-chain clusters in 3D protein structures.

Input
=====

Analysis was performed on the MC3 data file mc3.v0.2.8.PUBLIC.maf.gz (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7824274). The cancer type column
and filtering was performed using the suggested scripts (hypermutators were removed).

Only missense mutations were used.

Results
=======

We suggest a p-value threshold of 0.05.
